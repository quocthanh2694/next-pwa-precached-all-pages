This web app is directly inspired by Fred Fiquet's iPhone app and uses the same data.

## FAQ
### Does the app require Javascript?
The app will work if Javascript is disabled or unavailable, but some functionalities will work better with Javascript, e.g. the menu on mobile.

### How does the app handle my privacy?
The app does not collect any personal information. It does not track you with analytics tools either.

Our host platform collects data to monitor the performance of the pages but that data is anonymous and is not tied to any individual visitor or IP address.

### Does the app work offline?
Not yet, but it’s in the pipeline. Being able to use the app offline would make a big difference when playing where internet access is unreliable, e.g. at gaming events.

### How can I try the iPhone app?
The iPhone app is being actively developed and has not been released on the AppStore yet. In order to try it you need to install TestFlight from the AppStore, then [join the beta test](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yx9TdjFQ).
Requires iOS 13.2 or later.
